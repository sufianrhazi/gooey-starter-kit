# Gooey starter kit

An empty [Gooey](https://gooey.abstract.properties/) repository with `vite`, `typescript`, `eslint`, and `prettier`
preconfigured as a nice starting point.

Clone and hack away.

* `npm install` to install dependencies
* `npm run serve` to run a local server
* `npm run build` to build to `./dist/`
